GIGAWALLS SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

GigaWalls is built as a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) designed with a mobile-first philosophy to mimic high-end mobile apps like UHD Paper.

--- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ---
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

--- PROJECT STRUCTURE ---
- src/index.tsx: Entry point
- src/App.tsx: Main routing and layout
- src/components/: Reusable UI units (Cards, Navbars, Sliders)
- src/screens/: Main page views (Home, Detail)
- src/services/: Data fetching logic and mock API simulation
- src/types.ts: Global TypeScript definitions

--- GETTING STARTED ---
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

3. Open your browser:
   Visit http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in terminal)

--- KEY FEATURES ---
- Mobile Masonry Grid: Smooth 2-column grid that scales to desktop
- Infinite Scroll: Automatically loads more content as you scroll
- Dynamic Categories: Filter by 11 high-quality themes
- Real-time Search: Instant filtering across titles and tags
- Multi-Quality Downloads: Choice between HD, Full HD, QHD, and 4K
- Dark Premium UI: Using slate-950/900 palette with blue accents

--- DATA HANDLING ---
The app uses a 'wallpaperService' that simulates a backend. It generates unique wallpaper objects with metadata including:
- High-res source URL logic
- Category mapping
- Unique ID system
- Tag clouds
- Resolution specific dimensions

Wallpapers are "downloaded" by dynamically generating blob-like triggers for browser saving functionality.

--- READY FOR BUILD ---
To build for production:
npm run build

The output will be in the 'dist' folder, ready for deployment to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase).
